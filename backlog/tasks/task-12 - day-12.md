## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Final day! Time to prepare the tree, but there are lot of presents and we need to arrange them 
below the tree.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
I took a naive approach and it worked. The rotation and flipping were a red herring.

OK, i got my star and there is no way I could make the unit test to work. It turns out the test has a 
degenerated case that cant fit into the tree. The naive approach pushes an extra solution.

I had to rewrite everything lol, kudos Eric, what a troll :D
