## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
I have to find invalids ids using sort of pattern recognition. As in day 1, brute-force :)
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
First challenge was to understand the logic, it says in the sample that
95-115
has an invalid id 99. I was looking for the numbers themselves, took me 10 minutes rereading the puzzle to
understand it is a RANGE!
